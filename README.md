# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding advent calendar. This repository is intended as space
for collecting and sharing my solutions. This year, I'll be attempting to solve things in Python.

## Executing the Code

To run these solutions, `cd` to the root directory and run the solution file of a specific day.

```sh
$ python3 2022/01/solution.py
```
